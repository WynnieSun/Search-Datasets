   <h2>Dataset 1: Students Satisfaction in Four-Year Public College/University</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.ruffalonl.com/wp-content/ssi-samples/SSI%20Four-Year%20Public%20Sample.html">Dataset2</a></p>
   <ul>
     <li>Both datasets are about students satisfaction in college/university</li>
     <li>One is public school, and another one is private school</li>
     <li>Each database provides many survey questions (or items) concerning the overall satisfaction,
       </br >
       as well as their importance and satisfaction level for students</li>
     <li>I want to compare importance level with satisfaction level, and find out whether the school meets students' needs</li>
     <li>Then, compare the situation in public school and private school</li>
     </ul>
